Release Notes for Brisk 1.0 beta 1

Introduction to Brisk:
---------------------------------
Brisk is an open-source Hadoop and Hive distribution developed by DataStax that utilizes Apache Cassandra for its core services and storage. Brisk provides Hadoop MapReduce capabilities using CassandraFS, an HDFS-compatible storage layer inside Cassandra. By replacing HDFS with CassandraFS, users are able to leverage their current MapReduce jobs on Cassandra’s peer-to-peer, fault-tolerant, and scalable architecture. Brisk is also able to support dual workloads, allowing you to use the same cluster of machines for both real-time applications and data analytics without having to move the data around between systems.
Brisk is now available via Apache license v2.0. 
The DataStax team welcomes your valued feedback.
